# Football Player Market Value Prediction

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict football (soccer) player market value using performance and career data from major European leagues.

The goal is not only prediction accuracy, but also identifying potentially undervalued players by comparing predicted value tiers with current market tiers.

## Project Context
- Program: MS in Business Analytics (MSBA)
- School: Questrom School of Business, Boston University
- Course: Supervised Machine Learning

## Data
- Source: Transfermarkt
- Seasons: Multiple seasons across top European leagues
- Features: Player biographical data, performance metrics, playing time, and career history
- Target: Market value (EUR)

## Methods
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (best-performing model)

Key techniques used:
- Feature engineering
- Log transformation
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R²

## Key Outcome
The model highlights players whose predicted value tier exceeds their current market tier, suggesting potential undervaluation.
